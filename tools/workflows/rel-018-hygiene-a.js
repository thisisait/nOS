const RULES = `House rules (nOS; the repo's CLAUDE.md applies):
- Work ONLY in your own git worktree. Branch as your task names it, cut from ${BASE}.
- Push with "tools/nos-push --skip-sync origin HEAD:<branch>" (no Gitea mirror write), then confirm with
  "git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<branch>". NEVER push to dev or master; never merge into dev.
- Gate first: write the gate, run it to a log file, read the exit code (never through a pipe), see it RED for the
  RIGHT reason (the failing assertion names the missing behaviour; an ImportError/SyntaxError/missing fixture is
  not red), commit "test: ... (red)"; then the fix, green, commit. Changing an EXISTING test's expectation is its
  own commit "test: GATE CHANGE ..." with the why.
- Commits: Conventional Commits, subject <= 50 chars, body <= 6 bullets, NO Co-Authored-By line.
- Never read ~/.nos/secrets.yml, credentials.yml or any .env; never print a secret.
- Never touch the live estate: no ansible-playbook, no nos (except read-only "nos dtt status"), no
  launchctl/systemctl, no useradd/groupadd/chown, no writes to ~/wing, ~/thalamus, ~/.nos, ~/stacks, /var/lib,
  /etc. Never run anything under tests/e2e/journeys or tests/e2e/estate (they default to the LIVE Wing
  127.0.0.1:9000 and the live wing.db) and never import tests/e2e/lib/estate_secrets.py. Any test you write that
  talks HTTP or SQLite takes an explicit scratch URL/path with NO default pointing at a live one. Read-only live
  reads through the repo's readers (tools/*-status.py) are allowed and must be reported as such.
- Run only the lanes you touch plus the full "cargo test" of every crate you touch
  (CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/pazny/.cargo-target-nos). Gates stay Python; never port a gate.
- A new node in the anatomy graph gets an apex ruling entry (files/anatomy/apex/ruling.yml, "withheld" unless the
  row says otherwise) in its OWN clearly headed block. Do NOT commit regenerated artifacts (anatomy-graph,
  body-plan, IMPRINT, glossary, face layout pin): the integrator regenerates them once. Never run tools/apex-sign.py.
- The row that CREATES a thing owns every gate allow-list that thing needs (a new ssot article: its _BORN_IN_SSOT
  line in tests/anatomy/test_ssot_index.py; a new reader: its tools/README §Readers line; a new lockfile: its
  dependabot entry) as a "test: GATE CHANGE ..." commit of that row, never left for the operator.
- Expected-red is explicit per row: nothing else may be red on your branch; a reviewer refutes any other red lane.
- Rows are the spec; the roadmap files under ${SEED} are their source. Config keys, sudo, converges, closures of
  roadmap rows and anything destructive are the operator's: leave them in operator_questions.`
